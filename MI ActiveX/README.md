# MI ACTIVEX
Hi there !

i build this program because i wanted to discuss discretely with colleagues in my office XD.

With it, I seat up a BBD in a folder places in the network of our office that is open to write and read files.

we can only use this program in Internet Explorer with the plugin ActiveX activated.

Each user must open index.html in there navigator and have the same BDD adress.

Now, let's chat my friend !!
